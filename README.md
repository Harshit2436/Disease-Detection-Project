📖 About the Project
The Human Disease Detection Project is a machine learning–based system that predicts possible human diseases based on symptoms entered by the user. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied in the healthcare domain for early disease detection and learning purposes.

This project was developed by Akansha Rohilla and Harshit as an academic, beginner-level machine learning project.

✨ Features
Predicts diseases using given symptoms

Easy to understand and beginner friendly

Demonstrates practical use of machine learning

Useful for academic learning and practice

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes various symptoms and their related diseases.

Basic data preprocessing was performed to clean and prepare the data for model training.

⚙️ How It Works
The user enters symptoms

The input data is processed

A machine learning model analyzes the symptoms

The system predicts the most likely disease

🧠 Machine Learning Model
A machine learning classification algorithm is used to predict diseases

The model is trained on a symptoms-based dataset




📌 Future Improvements
Add more symptoms and diseases

Improve model accuracy

Develop a web or mobile interface
